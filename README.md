# Python-Try-Except

## Purpose
This Python script demonstrates the usage of exception handling in various scenarios. It includes examples of handling arithmetic errors, type errors, and file operations using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` for exception handling.
- Handle different types of errors, such as arithmetic errors and type errors.
- Implement file operations with proper error handling.

## Instructions
1. Run the script by executing `python {script_name}.py` in the terminal.
2. Uncomment the specific function calls within the `main()` function to test different exception-handling scenarios.
    - Uncomment `tryAdd()` to see how arithmetic errors are handled.
    - Uncomment `errTryAdd()` to observe the handling of type errors.
    - Uncomment `usingTryFinally()` to see the usage of `finally` for cleanup operations.
    - Uncomment `multiTry()` to demonstrate exception handling during file operations.

## Note
- Ensure that you have Python installed to run the script successfully.
- Customize the script or import it into your own project as needed.
